# Fixtures

This folder holds real case-study inputs for the v0 demo.

- Each case study is a JSON file under `data/fixtures/case_studies/`.
- Do not include fake or invented values. Use real agent output and real evidence.
- If a field is unknown, omit it or set it to `null` and let the evaluator mark it as
  "Not Evaluated".

See `data/fixtures/schema_v0.json` for the canonical structure.
